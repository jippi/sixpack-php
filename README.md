# Sixpack

PHP client library for SeatGeak's Sixpack ab testing framework.

## Installation

Simply clone the project and include `sixpack.php` to your PHP Project

## Usage

**ALL THIS IS OUT OF DATE**

Basic example:

The PHP client stores a unique client id in the current user's cookie by default.

```php
$sp = new \Seatgeek\Sixpack\Session;
$alt = $sp->participate('test', array('blue', 'red'))->getAlternative();
if ($alt == 'blue') {
    /* do something blue */
} else {
    /* do somethign red */
}
```

Each session has a `client_id` associated with it that must be preserved across requests. The PHP client handles this automatically. If you'd wish to change that behavoir, you can do so like this:

```php
$sp = new \Seatgeek\Sixpack\Session;
$resp = $sp->participate("new-test", array("alternative-1", "alternative-2"));
store_in_database("sixpack-id", $resp->getClientId());
```

For future requests, create the `Session` using the `client_id` stored in the cookie:

```php
$client_id = get_from_database("sixpack-id")
$sp = new \Seatgeek\Sixpack\Session(array('clientId' => $client_id));

$sp->convert('new-test');
```

Other possible options for the Session constructor are:
* baseUrl - Sixpack Server's location on the web
* cookiePrefix - you can set a different prefix for the cookie if you like. Default is `sixpack`

If you'd like to force the Sixpack server to return a specific alternative for development or testing, you can do so by passing a query parameter named `sixpack-force` to that page being tested.

`http://example.com/?sixpack-force-<experiment name>=<alternative name>`
